# AGE-AND-GENDER-DETECTOR

The process of detection involves identifying various attributes based on input data, and one of the challenging tasks in recent years has been age and gender detection. This project aims to determine a person's age and gender using a webcam, which can have practical applications in various scenarios such as managing queues in railway reservations or gas stations.

Modern research has delved into extracting additional information from various biometric sources like fingerprints, facial features, iris scans, palm prints, and voice patterns. This information encompasses a wide range of attributes, including gender, age, presence of facial hair, scars, height, hair characteristics, skin color, eyeglasses, weight, facial marks, and tattoos, among others. These attributes have become increasingly valuable for identification purposes.

One of the significant advancements in face recognition technology is the ability to accurately estimate a person's age and gender. This project conducts a comprehensive survey of various face recognition techniques designed for this purpose. Existing methodologies are assessed based on their performance, and the project also outlines potential future directions in this field.

Age and gender, as two fundamental facial attributes, hold immense importance in social interactions. This project relies on computer vision techniques, utilizing various image processing methods to accurately determine a person's age and gender from an image.
